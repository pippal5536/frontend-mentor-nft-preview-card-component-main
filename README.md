- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

```
/*I learnt how to center an element.Thanks to Fireship.[FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/njdJeu95p6s)*/
/*Classic Approach:*/
.parent{
  position: relative;
}
.child{
  position: absolute;
  top:50%;
  left:50%;
  transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}
/*Modern Approach*/
.parent{
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
/* I knew hsl. But I learnt about hsla by doing is project. */
```

### Continued development

I need to practice height and width
